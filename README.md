# Chess Bot with TensorFlow

## Overview

This project is a Chess Bot implemented using TensorFlow. The bot is capable of playing chess against human opponents and making intelligent decisions based on the current state of the board. It leverages neural networks to evaluate positions and generate optimal moves, aiming to provide a challenging experience for players of all skill levels.

## Features

- **Move Prediction**: Learning from thousands of games and predicting the best move.
- **Position Evaluation**: Employs a neural network trained on thousands of chess games to evaluate the strength of board positions.
